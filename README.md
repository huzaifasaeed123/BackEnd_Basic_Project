# Backend Basic Project Overview

This repository contains a series of backend projects using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and SQL. Each project serves as an exercise to understand various backend functionalities, database integrations, and CRUD operations.

## Projects Overview:

### 1. Express Basic Setup
- A foundational setup of an Express.js application to understand basic server creation, routing, and middleware usage.

### 2. File Integration & Retrieval Practice
- Explores multiple methods of integrating and retrieving data across files using Node.js.

### 3. Custom Error Handler
- Demonstrates creating and implementing custom error-handling middleware for Express.js applications.

### 4. Instagram App (EJS Templating)
- Uses EJS templating with Express.js to dynamically render user profiles and implement simple features like dice rolls.

### 5. Qoura Post Management Application
- Implements CRUD operations to manage posts using Express.js with dynamic EJS rendering, UUIDs, and method override.

### 6. Chat Application With MongoDB
- A complete CRUD application utilizing MongoDB for backend data storage, designed specifically for chat management.

### 7. User Management Application (SQL)
- Uses MySQL to demonstrate robust user management, including CRUD operations and secure database interactions.

### 8. MongoDB Relation
- Explores relational data handling in MongoDB, demonstrating user-post-customer relationships using schemas and models.


## Requirements:
- Node.js installed locally.
- MongoDB installed locally for MongoDB-related projects.
- MySQL installed locally for SQL-related projects.

---
Each of these projects incrementally builds a deeper understanding of backend concepts, integrating databases, handling data operations, and enhancing server-side application development skills.
